** Looked down upon by many
**** /Times/ reporter
=The composition of popular songs, whether it be the words or the music, seems to be largely a matter of knack ... The greatest hits do not display any considerable degree of literary or musical ability. The words are generally inane and the construction not infrequently ungrammatical. The music is often such a simple tune as a child might conceive.... The minstrel ballad writers of old probably brought more talent to bear upon their work and took greater pains with it than do their latter-day successors. The former followed their vocation for the love of the thing, and looked for no greater compensation than the means of keeping body and soul together.=
**** /Tribune/
=Song writers, publishers and play producers recognize the fact that their public wants this music... And untrained 'composers' at once turn out thousands of the kind of song that at once debase all who sing and hear.=
