Interactive computer music systems change their behavior in response to musical input. This also allows them to be used in live performance.

There are a few classifications of interactive music systems. The first is score-driven versus performance-driven, which largely deals with what is stored. The next is transformative, generative, and sequenced. These deal with how the system is creating music. Additionally there is a difference between instrument and player paradigms. Is the instrument enhanced or are there unseen performers as well?

All of these interactive systems use a three-stage process of sensing, processing, and response. MIDI is often the bridge between all of these stages.
