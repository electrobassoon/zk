#+title: hand profiling skinner

Here is Skinner's method for hand profiling.
1) Partially dry cane under lamp for 20 minutes
2) With dividers, mark collar in bark at 30mm from each butt
3) Score collar marks from one side of cane to other with knife edge file
4) Place cane on easel, use a sharp heavy knife. Heavier and wider the spine the less likely it will chatter
5) Draw it back and forth between collar marks in the center. Take center to .85mm
6) Remove bark on either side of center strip and blend so it is even under the light. Smooth with 220WD
7) Mark 50 from each butt, then reduce
   1) Profile between 50mm marks down to .5
   2) Mark 55 from butt.. Using 220WD go down to .35
8) Smooth center portion with 220WD and entire blade with 300
9) Add center mark and score with knife edge file
