#+title: Vibrato


"One very important factor is the resistance you are blowing against. The higher the resistance the less the undulations are, and justifiably so. In the low register, where there is no/very little resistance, the vibrato is slower which is natural. And the higher you went with resistance the vibrato becomes much more subtle. I also involve my reeds with it too because resistance also has to do with reeds." - Norman Herzberg [[cite:&lowe08_norman_herzb]]

"If you come upon a student who is really a beginner and starts playing for you with a lovely vibrato, SHUT UP about it because it’s a gift. I don’t know how they do it. I struggled with vibrato that I wanted all my life. But, there were times when it would just come right and it pleased me no end." - Norman Herzberg [[cite:&lowe08_norman_herzb]]
