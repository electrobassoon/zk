Musicians should be taught in the new technology. Many have aversions to it, but that is a form of schizophrenia as musicians use new technology in their everyday lives. All musicians should know how their instrument is best recorded, as much as knowing how to play their instrument.

Traditional music study is at its end. The art will be preserved by the best as other native art forms have been preserved, but it is not for everyone anymore. It must be renewed through technology to reach new heights.
