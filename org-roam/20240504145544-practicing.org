#+title: Practicing

Weissenborn is first to talk about practice time. He says an hour daily, 20 minutes at a time, and then little by little make those 20 minutes be 30 minutes. After 3 to 4 months, two hours a day one hour at a time. After a year or so, three hours one at a time. More than that is seldom beneficial. [[cite:&schillinger16_bassoon_reed_makin]] 35

Having a good reed is important. To quote Almenraeder:
"The bassoonist, even when arriving at an advanced stage through study and practice, must nevertheless depend to a great extent upon his reed. He may have one of the finest instruments and may be in a perfect mind for practicing but if his reed is defective he will remain its slave; a slave to whom all freedom of movement is prohibited."
