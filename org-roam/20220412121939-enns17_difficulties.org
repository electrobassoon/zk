Balance is almost impossible to determine while you are on stage. It's also really hard to make changes to that balance on stage during a performance.

Clip on mics can increase the weight of the instrument. Standing still next to a mic stand can increase tension. Transporting equipment can also put physical strain on the performer.

Loudspeaker feedback can cause hearing damage. Make sure to have a way to kill the sound quickly if you are running the sound yourself.
