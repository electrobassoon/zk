Currently, many performers first are exposed to the technology required for a performance at the dress rehearsal. This is simply not enough time. In all the pilot studies, performers most frequent response was wanting more time with the technology.

There are many things that are new from a physical standpoint for the performer as well. Microphones are often placed very close to a performer, which limits expressive motion. Cables cause latency in sound as well as at times getting in the way of movement as well.

This is too much to throw at a performer in a dress rehearsal and expect them to feel confident for the performance.
