Notes from lecture given at IDRS 2025 in Butler

Use theory every day in practice

Development of expression is intellect

Melody
- arpeggiation of chord tones
- non harmonic tones
  - contour
  - rhythm
  - meter
  - dynamics
  - etc.

Old -> New
nonfunctional harmony
every piece is governed by something
uncover patterns, shifts, transgressions, etc.
Use these to form interpretation

Explore every piece you prepare
Let curiosity guide you
Don't be afraid of being wrong
Lead students through this process
