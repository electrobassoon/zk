* Introduction
** page 2
What is live electronic music? Can have two meanings
1) Music that stages the dichotomy of live (=human) vs. electronics (=sound generated by some electrically powered device) Somewhat in opposition to acousmatic music
This term somewhat embodies technophobia and came as a result of radio broadcasts of classical music

2) The other definition implies that electronic sound production is happening in real time
This term implies some kind of interactive used of electronic devices

Ungeheuer's classifications again
1) The first definition of performer vs tape
2) technology allows a performer to surpass the limitations of instrumental performance

3)  Interaction between performing agents

These happened more or less chronologically, 1 was first. 2 and 3 somewhat overlap each other

3 paradigms of development from Emmerson
1) miniaturization of circuits allow signal processing
2) revolution of personal computer and invention of MIDI for event processing in real time
3) processing power of computers and laptops allow real time processing
