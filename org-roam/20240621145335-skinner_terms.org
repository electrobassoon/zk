* Measurements
Blade Length: Length from tip edge to collar
Bahn Length: Length from tip edge to beginning of first wire
Full Fundamental Length: Length from tip edge to beginning of second wire
Capo d'astro: Wire 1 and it's tuning effect by sliding around
Flucrum: Wire 2
50mm : Mark that is 6mm behind the tip (actually 50mm if the reed is 56mm long)
43mm: Mark 43mm from the but with a 30mm collar. With a brevis reduce this by the brevis ammount

* Concepts
Linearly Dampened: The greatest degree of dampening is done longitudinallyâ€”meaning along the fibers, from collar to tip edge
Laterally or Horizontally dampened: The greatest degree of dampening is done from side to side
Pyramiding Fibers: Having a slope through layers of fibers. It can be inside or outside the reed
Brevis: Cutting the tube to have wider blades with the same length of reed
