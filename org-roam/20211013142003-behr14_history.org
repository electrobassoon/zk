Cage possibly had the first work for live instruments with prerecorded sound. MIDI helped standardize communication. Max came about in the late 90s.

For bassoon, the first piece with tape was probably Dittrich's /Kammermusic I/. Schwartz and Fongarrd also had some in the 70s. As Max came to be, Boush, Rothkopf, and Hurdy have some seminal works.
