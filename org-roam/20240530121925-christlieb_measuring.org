The dial indicator is not a cure all, you can still make bad reeds with "perfect" measurements. But it does help to deal with lack of symmetry and carelessness in scraping.

But it is also a danger to try and make measurements perfect and ignore everything else. He shows a really good reed that didn't have perfect measurements, and said he had to discard reeds that had better measurements. The dial indicator is an aid, not a substitute, to the ears and eyes.
