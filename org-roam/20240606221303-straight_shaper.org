#+title: straight shaper

Cooper disliked them because most of them don't match on all four sides. But he still admits that acceptable results can be obtained with them. Another benefit is being able to shape more than one piece of cane at a time, but most people don't use that advantage. [[cite:&cooper08_reed_makin_notes_two]]

Herzberg on the other hand likes how the cane isn't clamped and buckled like a foldover shaper. Perhaps part of the reason for his preference is because the shaper he developed was actually very accurate on all four sides, more than anything else.[[cite:&lowe08_norman_herzb]]
