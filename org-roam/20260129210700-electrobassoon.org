  - Socials (YT/IG): `@electrobassoon`

* Workflow A: Software Processing (Max/MSP)
  - *OS*: Windows
  - *Logic*: Use Max/MSP for effects -> Route via *VB Matrix* -> Record in *Pure Data*.
  - *Recording Specs*:
    - Track 1: Dry Bassoon Input
    - Track 2: Little Jake Input
    - Track 3,4: Max/MSP Wet Output
  - *Context Note*: Since no Max license, ensure the Pd patch is set to the correct sample rate before starting the Max runtime.
  - Next time try the Little Jake straight into the interface. It sounds a bit tubby and almost unusable.
** Ardour Process
  - Reverb bus
  - The LSP Enhancer helps with the noise floor and not sounding so distant
  - Output the electronics at the bottom of the strip to a separate bus
  - Use the *LSP Compressor* with a sidechain to duck the electronics when the bassoon plays. Use the pin in out button to set that up.
  - Group tracks to try and cut in the same places

* Workflow B: Hardware Processing (Pedals)
  - *OS*: Linux (Gentoo)
  - *Logic*: Physical Pedals -> Interface -> *Ardour*.
  - *Advantage*: Stays in the native mastering environment. No file transfer needed.

* Visuals: projectM Preset Development
  - *Status*: Struggling with preset creation.

* Breadcrumbs (Handover)
  - *Last Action*: Chronomancer first recording done.
  - *Stuck Point*: projectM preset isn't showing image. May need to give up on a custom preset.
  - *Next Step*: Redo mixing process that was lost. Add sidechain, redirect tracks, tweak eq, cut and rearrange takes, location markers for those takes, remove redundant max takes
  - *Next Recording*: See if there's a way to lower the latency in VBMatrix
