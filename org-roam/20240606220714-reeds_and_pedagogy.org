"Instruction in reed-making skills must be the teacher’s responsibility and must never be delegated. Of course teaching bassoon is much more than teaching reed-making, but I think this essential part of a bassoonist’s education deserves special mention. Reeds are the link through which one breathes life into the instrument. They are each performer’s personally designed connection between the manufactured instrument and the realization of the physical, mental, and musical capabilities exercised in performance. As any performer improves, more demands are made on  this critical element. A bassoon teacher, during the course of lessons, must know whether reeds are the cause of difficulties." - Norman Herzberg [[cite:&lowe08_norman_herzb]]
