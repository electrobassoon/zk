Fold the cane over a thin straight edge, but take the edge out before the fold is complete so the tip doesn't break. Keep the pressure on the tip until it is on the shaper. Flexing the cane too much will also cause it to break. When using the shaper, don't tighten it all the way at first, because the cane can crack. Tighten it most of the way and take a majority of the cane out. Then tighten it all the way to finish it. After it's done, TAKE IT OFF THE SHAPER and then sand the edges with 220WD.
