*** At least first occurance should have word gliss.

*** Make sure it isn't confused with voice leading lines

*** With accidentals, default is next to, but can also adjust

*** Unisons go in direction of gliss (auto)

*** Avoid clef changes

*** Use ties if gliss delayed

*** Chord glisses only one label (not automatic)

*** Finishing grace note and parenthesis

*** Intermediate notes and parenthesis

** Trills

*** Only long slurs and octave signs go above the trill

*** Line lasts for entire note (sib doesn't follow ties), stops right at next notehead or its accidental (sib won't notice) or to barline

*** Accidental by creating a new symbol and a new line

*** Grace note for a defined pitch in parenthesis with an X shift, hide flag, drag stem down

*** Grace note terminations

** Tremolos

*** input at half value, choose beam numbers

*** tied to next measure with slurs

*** break beams (auto?)

** Arpeggios

*** Extends all notes (not stems)

*** Cross staff if there's an accidental

*** Above almost all other notation

*** Slur vs triplet vs octave depend on longest

*** Change style if wanted
