While microphones provide the most accurate sound, there is a risk of feedback. The bocals reduce that, but sacrifice the bassoon's tone quality.

Paul Hanson talks about the narrower dynamic range of playing on a pickup. The bassoon already has a small range compared to other instruments (Jeff Lyman) but it's even smaller in an electric bocal. Getting a volume pedal can help solve this difficulty.

Jeff Lyman says that each piece seems to require buying a new piece of equipment, or some new technical setup.

Trent Jacobs says that while guitar resources can be helpful with effects pedals, not everything transfers to bassoon easily or well or even at all.
