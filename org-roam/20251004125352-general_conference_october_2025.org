* Elder Stevenson
Be a peacemaker.
Consider a 3 step 1 week peacemaking program
1) Non contenious home
 - When it comes, reboot
2) Build digital bridges
3) Repair a strained relationship
* Sister Browning
Primary songs are best way to plant seeds of testimony in youngest disciples of Christ
*  Eyre
The adversary labels us by our weaknesses
Seek validation veritcally not horizontally
We are children of God
* Kelly R Johnson
Have I distanced myself from God?
It is up to me to reconcile myself to God and he will draw near to me
* Elder Uchtdorff
If you stop practicing and studying you will gradually lose what you had
This also applies to becoming a disciple of Jesus Christ
Discipleship takes self discipline, it's not casual and doesn't happen by accident
If we fail to use faith we become less sure and confident in what we knew. Temptations look more appealing
The fire of yesterdays testimony can only warm us for so long, it needs nourishment to continue burning brightly
