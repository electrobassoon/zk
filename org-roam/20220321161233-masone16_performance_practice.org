Performance practice normally deals with the score of a piece. In electroacoustic music, it needs to go further. Amplification, computers, hardware, etc. are possibilities.

Performers need lots of time rehearsing with the electronics.

"Some performers don't realize how much they must practice with their electronics and get to know them - or think they can just learn their part and means they have learned the piece. A piece with live electronics should be chamber music. This never comes up with those who commission my pieces, but it sometimes does as the pieces go out into the world." -- Nathan Davis
