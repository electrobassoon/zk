#+title: preparing gouged cane


The inside of the gouge should be sanded to correct any minor imperfections in symmetry. Sandpaper or emery cloth should be bent over the edge of a table to make sure it forms to the shape of the cane. 400-600 grit is ideal. 600 will result in a brighter sound than 400 grit.

After the initial sanding, wet the cane all over with a wet finger. After it dries, there are likely raised fibers again. So sand them out and wet it again. Most cane this takes 3 to 4 times before it stays smooth. This should be done before prolonged soaking happens.
