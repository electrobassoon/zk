Presentation given at IDRS 2025 by Ben Roidl-Ward

** Acoustical complexities of the bassoon
- Conical bore that doubles back
- Oblique tone holes
- open holes and keys
- Thumbs and Pinkies
- Octave mechanisms / techniques
- Varies from instrument

we seek evenness of intonation, response, and resonance
Standard fingerings are the best combination

** Reasons to alter standard fingerings
- Technical combinations
- Trills
- Extreme dynamics
- Tuning in a chord
- Awkward slurs
- Tone color
- Unexoected Situations
- Extended Techniques

** When using altered fingerings:
- Fingerings are only part of the solution (still use embouchure, air, etc)
- Good to have options
- Awareness of fingerings and its tendencies
- Seamless introduction - audience can't tell
- Sometimes no time to experiment
** Tenor C#
French without the C# key?
trill third finger for a D?
right trill key even sneakier than short?

SPEAR for audio analysis (mac only)

** Open F
Low d, 1, 2, | 2, 3 all options to change

** Fingering Maps
Manipulation options from standard fingerings
