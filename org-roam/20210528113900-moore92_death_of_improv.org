Improvisation was extremely important centruies ago, in fact almost nothing was unaffected by it. However as amateurs became more involved in music, there was a fear from professionals that their improvisation was not correct. They discouraged it, and began writing out what they should do. Being less and less familiar with the older music, performers were self concious about performing the music incorrectly. Conservatories developed to educate musicians in the music of the past. Some efforts were made to control the music of the public. In the end, it just created a wider barrier between the music people understood and the music they were supposed to perform. Recordings further increased this self consciousness.
