Soaking cane for a long time seems to have great benefits! Lacy says that 5 days should be the minimum, it will take out all of the sodium and other water soluble salts in the cane. Cane has a more uniform color, the texture is consistent, no need to break reeds in, reeds last longer, and reed making is more consistent!

You should use distilled water, in a tightly covered container, in the dark. Change the water every 48 hours. 5 days is enough, but it can go up to 8 months.
