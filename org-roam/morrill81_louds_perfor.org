   :END:
Many performance spaces created for frontal and heroic performances
Loudspeakers often disadvantaged in these spaces

Many performers turn up the speakers when they can't hear

   :END:
Speakers are concentrated and directional
Live performers are diffuse
The two don't combine very well in traditional spaces
** Stereo Placement
   :PROPERTIES:
   :NOTER_PAGE: (5 . 0.5807453416149069)
   :END:
Proper stereo placement is 30 degrees from center
Large separation disturbs the balance of performer and sound balance
Large halls two or three on each side at various angles may be good
Raising speakers is often beneficial
