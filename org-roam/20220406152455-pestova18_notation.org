Electroacoustic music does not have a unified system for notation. Each new piece requires learning a new "dialect" of the notation. The main problems are trying to graphically represent the sound, and not having symbols to accurately reflect what the electronics are doing. There are a variety of approaches to try and solve these problems. Perhaps the best option is to have a separate study score and performance score for each piece.
