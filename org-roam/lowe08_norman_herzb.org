Herzberg quickly learned Pezzi would let him get away with anything. Am I that way? Do my students know they can get away with anything and give me excuses and I let them get away with it?

“It’s three and a half octaves of
anything people want. You have to play pianissimo in the lowest register and the highest
register. You have to have technique from the bottom b-flat up to god knows where.”51

human voice. We can sing! The bassoon handles vibrato beautifully and it homogenizes

I have yet to be convinced they have any place in the curriculum for a
career in music. My experience teaches me that bands have become
ensembles for the usual overflow of clarinets, saxophones, brass players,
and other instrumentalists who cannot be accommodated in the orchestras.
Requiring serious bassoon students to devote school time to band playing
wastes time far better spent studying the literature central to their future
careers. I have yet to encounter anyone who wants to play in band.

Instruction in reed-making skills must be the teacher’s responsibility and
must never be delegated. Of course teaching bassoon is much more than
teaching reed-making, but I think this essential part of a bassoonist’s
education deserves special mention. Reeds are the link through which one
breathes life into the instrument. They are each performer’s personally
designed connection between the manufactured instrument and the
realization of the physical, mental, and musical capabilities exercised in
performance. As any performer improves, more demands are made on 
this critical element. A bassoon teacher, during the course of lessons,
must know whether reeds are the cause of difficulties.

The essentials of practice fall into three categories: scales, long notes and
intervals. During practicing of these essentials, sensitivity to and skill
with reed correction develops. Reeds must be improved and not blamed.
I believe that reeds must closely approach or be equal to the tasks you
demand of them. Your playing skills must fill in the gaps that reeds leave
open.

One very important factor is the resistance you are blowing against. The
higher the resistance the less the undulations are, and justifiably so. In the
low register, where there is no/very little resistance, the vibrato is slower
which is natural. And the higher you went with resistance the vibrato
becomes much more subtle. I also involve my reeds with it too because
resistance also has to do with reeds.

If you come upon a student who is really a beginner and starts playing for

Recently, in a conversation with one of my former pupils who is in one of
the major symphonies, he remarked that during their studies with me, I
kept my students honest. I do have a great deal of affection for my
students, but I don’t trust them without checking. I have found that it
requires attention to their assignments, a constant listening to their practice
of the fundamentals, and use of many “tools” to develop integrity in their
playing. One of the most important teaching tools, in my opinion, is the
tuner.

2) Performer must make the decision - no input from others during testing

5) No prior warming up or additional notes at all
6) Try to test only once, maybe twice. More than that and you get used to it
7) As soon as a better one is found, that is the new standard
8) Used a b flat arpeggio from Bb to high D, slurred, at mf. Focus could be on the sound not the music

Reason for long tones is consistency over a long period of time. Usually done on "bad" notes. Practicing something that is already easy is "doodling" instead of actual practice.

:END:
Knew many liked a wider shape, but thought they would enjoy the benefits of a wider shape.
Wide shapes do well with the lower half of the bassoon, but have to be careful about E sagging, and the money register (middle C to F above)
Wire adjustments can help, but the greater arch puts more pressure on the sides of the blade. (not sure what that does exactly, deadens the vibrations?) 
High register is also difficult.
Can't brighten the tone by trimming the middle of the tip because E and C# will collapse. Narrow shapes eliminate these faults (within reason obviously)
** Wires

:NOTER_PAGE: (101 0.2786885245901639 . 0.18899204244031828)
:END:
The wires control the opening of the tip, the arch of the blades, and the shape of the tube.
Tip is response, arch of blades is resistance, shape of tube is intonation and tone quality.
Wires should be tight. Tight wires keep their adjustments. Loose wires don't control things as well and are inconsistent.
"Choking" can easily be removed with appropriate trimming of the blade, which improves attach and tone. (so far no indication like Cooper of a semi loose first wire)
** Wire shape
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_PAGE: (102 0.14754098360655737 . 0.17970822281167106)
:END:
Second and third wires should always be round. First is more oval, but could be more round if that was the preference.
A round second wire gave strength to the blades, which gives the resistance to blow against with an easy attacking reed. It helps with a full tone and having the *pitch high enough in the money register*.
The sharpness of the lower register with a round 2nd wire could be fixed with relaxing the embouchure and or scraping the bottom half of the reed. A slight flattening may be needed. (I think Cooper might like a more oval second wire?)
** Wire Placement
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_PAGE: (102 0.5245901639344263 . 0.1982758620689655)
:END:
good placement optimizes the adjustment effects
The first wire should be based on the spot on the shaper where the blade begins to flare outwards. The first wire should be 1/16th of an inch above that flare.
The second wire should be 5/16ths of an inch below the first wire (so 1/16th of an inch behind the flare)
Third wire should be in the center of the legs of the "V" created by the bevel. (to be explained hopefully)
So a short bevel (3/8ths from the bottom of the reed) the third wire would be 3/16ths from the bottom.

His shoulders were .036 and .037 inches thick. This should be cut in before the cane is folded. Scoring begins 3/16ths of an inch below the collar and should be evenly spaced across each half of the tube. (no real mention of where the collar should be. Probably because his profiler did it)

A temporary first wire an inch from the bottom of the tube. Then wrap it in wet butcher's twine down the length of the tube. Heat the forming mandrel and insert into the end. No twisting because it would slip blades (which Cooper says happens anyways)
After the mandrel is in as far as it will go, start squeezing the sides of the tube and pushing the mandrel until the correct point. Continue squeezing until the sides of the tube come together.

After the reed is dry, remove the string and the temporary first wire and open it up. 
Short bevel is a pencil mark at 3/8ths of an inch from the bottom on each rail. He would use a file to remove the sharp points down to the end. Care was taken to not remove any bark. That would make a tube too small to fit on a bocal.
If the tip separates in this procedure, he bevels and then lines the blades back up at the shoulder (perhaps reason to make it before hand) and wind up string to the second wire. Then puts on the second wire and then third and then first.
Longer bevel starts higher up the tube. Can be anywhere up to the second wire. Higher than that brings leaks.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Most shapers (especially any of the standard
Rieger shapers) do not have anywhere near enough flare to do it properly.
However, in showing several others this procedure I have found that if one
is very, very careful it can be done by ever so slightly beveling the very
end of the tube beyond the pulp and into the bark. One can then place the
third wire more toward the butt than we who use your shaper need in order
to enhance the bevel even further. As you mention, great care is then
required in reaming the reed as the tube wall can be quite thin (about a
32nd or so after reaming) but with a proper wrap and good coating of Duco
over the wrap I have never seen anyone have problems. Of course a
thicker gouge would also help by providing more of a fulcrum against
which the bevel can work.

*** Wires
3rd stays round regardless of the bevel. 
2nd wire stays round for both short and long bevels unless a slight flattening is needed for the bottom octave. We want the strength of tone that comes with the round 2nd wire.
1st wire needs to be flattened slightly for comfort with a short bevel. This eases the response and lessens the lip pressure needed. If it closes after playing it may need to be rounded slightly.
As the bevel increases, the first wire needs to be more round. This gives a strong arch that makes the resistance we want. But there needs to be more trimming in the front half.
*** Trimming
The round second wire in the short bevel (and long bevel?) will raise the lowest octave. Trimming the back half helps to lower these notes.
*** Shape
Short bevel is good for a shape with a wide flare. The wide flare keeps the pitch low in the bottom register and helps with low note response. The short bevel also raises the pitch in the middle register, which is typically flat on a wide shape, and eases high note response (also a challenge with a wide reed).
** Noticeable results of the bevel

:NOTER_PAGE: (109 0.6065573770491803 . 0.1982758620689655)
:END:
*** Tip opening
Short bevel creates large tip openings. First wire thus needs to be flattened. Short bevel creates less pressure between the two blades and reduces the need to scrape tip for response. Short bevel reeds have a lower pitch because of the flattened first wire.
The long bevel creates a smaller tip opening. The first wire needs to be rounded as a result. The long bevel has the blades press more strongly against each other and has a higher pitch because of the round first wire.
** Blade slippage

:END:
After beveling would take fine sandpaper (400 to 600) and lighlty sand the sharp edge inside the tube rails. From beginning of bevel up to mark for the first wire (is this like Cooper's gradual bevel?) The slightly flattened surface made more contact area for the rails and helped minimize blade slippage (which Cooper says still happens)

"I make reeds from the front to the back.. The heavier in the front the lesser sensitivity but you've got to really slap it." To correct you thin the tip. If it isn't responding by halfway down the blade it probably never will.

I would be remiss if I did not emphasize that proper bassoon practice is
necessary in order to be an accomplished reed maker. Your reeds will be
better only when you make demands on them and those demands are
defined by your playing deficiencies. Practicing reveals shortcomings and
knowledge of reed making can help eliminate difficulties. As you become
a better performer your reeds must improve. Proper practice must include
disciplined routines for scales, intervals, and long tones. Trying a reed by
random playing does not define it as much as scales with different
articulations over the whole range of the bassoon, long tones on
problematic pitches and slurred intervals over the range of the
instrument.”

Reeds don't have to crow to be good.
All wires must be tight
Second wire must be round
Trimming should be done in the upper half of the blade.
Thickness at the shoulder should be .036 to .037 inches (.91-.93 mm)
Start bevel at 3/8ths of an inch
Security is knowing that you have a large reserve,, over 100, ,of seasoned blanks to choose from. (That's a lot!!)
