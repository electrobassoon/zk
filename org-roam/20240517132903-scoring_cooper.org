#+title: scoring cooper

He scores 7 cuts, just through the bark. One is in the exact center, then equidistant on each side, then halfway between each of the sections. The center score has to be exact! These sections will later be "torn" up to the second wire by pliers after the first two wires are on. He says some (like I have done) will use razor blades to slice up to the collar, but he says this doesn't follow the natural curvature of the cane.
