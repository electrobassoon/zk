#+title: Tone difference


The perspective we have as a performer needs to be brighter, reedier, and louder than the ideal sound we want the listener to hear. At the distance of about 15-20 feet, the edginess of the sound disappears in to the resonance of the listener. If we try and make a reed that plays extra dark, etc., it will sound dead to the listener 15-20 feet away. The challenge is to find the balance.
