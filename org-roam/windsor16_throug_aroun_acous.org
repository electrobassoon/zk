Definition of acousmatic - denies a visual source for its constituent sound (7) Schaeffer coined the term.

Schaeffer had 4 different modes of listening, identifying events, interpreting those events, occurrence of sound, and the qualities of sound (8)

Breaking through the acousmatic screen to give causes to the sound is a part of musical interpretation in acousmatic music (9)

I think the main point is on page 22, that listening to acousmatic music allows for interpretation because there is a conflict between the structure we live on a daily basis, and the structure that the sounds are creating which likely contradicts the other? (22)

Acousmatic music is not just obscuring the sounds, but intensifies the listener's search for understanding the sources of the sounds, and what they mean. (31)
