#+title: forming herzberg

Herzberg formed the tube by putting on a temporary wire an inch above the butt. Then he wrapped the reed in wet butcher's twine for the rest of the tube. He heated his forming mandrel and pushed it in until it wouldn't go anymore. Then he squished the side of the reed with pliers and pushed the mandrel until it went in to the desired depth. Then he kept squeezing until the sides of the tube came together.

At this point, he would let the reed "season" for two weeks inside the cocoon. He gives the analogy of rolling up paper versus having a rubber band around it. After two weeks the tube will be stable and can be beveled.
