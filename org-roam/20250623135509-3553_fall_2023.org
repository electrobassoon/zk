* Class 5 9/14/2023
** Slurs

*** Different Meanings

**** Winds and Brass

**** Strings

**** Voice
*** s or select passage

*** During input S and shift S

*** Flipping with X

*** Adjusting handles

**** Resetting if you mess up

****  Disable magnetic for cross staff

*** Adjusting ends when extending over breaks

** Articulations

*** Except in two stemmed, it goes over the noteheads

**** Or limited space below, and except the marcato (sibelius won't let you flip it)

*** Double stemmed

**** Each voice needs its own articulations, including unisons!

**** Aritculations go to the stem side

***** Don't move it closer than the end of the stem!

*** During input and after input

*** Clearing articulations

*** Flip with X

** Grace Notes

*** Always stem up except double stemmed writing

*** Slurs below notehead (sibelius won't do this automatically!)

*** Independent slurs, even when slur is long

*** Articulations where they are conspicuous (sibelius doesn't do this automatically!)

*** Dynamics tend to go to main note unless there are a lot of grace notes

** Beams

*** Sibelius usually good on secondary beams, but not always (3/8 eg)

*** Manually add a secondary beam for 4 64ths notes

*** Global change

*** Feathered Beams

*** over rests


* Class 6 9/19/2023
** Dynamics

*** Hairpins

**** H and Shift H and Shift L during input, alt arrows to select handles

**** Multiple at once

** Text in General

*** One at a time

*** Copy with shift alt click vs alt click

*** Alt click to get same style

*** Multi select (first notes of measures only?)

*** Align in column

** Tempo Marks
*** System Object Positions in Appearance Tab
*** Align them
*** Modulations with = signs

** Expressions and Technique text

*** position (esp with lyrics)

*** Center dynamics, sibelius won't do this for you!!!


* Class 7 9/21/2023
** Glissandi

*** At least first occurance should have word gliss.

*** Make sure it isn't confused with voice leading lines

*** With accidentals, default is next to, but can also adjust

*** Unisons go in direction of gliss (auto)

*** Avoid clef changes

*** Use ties if gliss delayed

*** Chord glisses only one label (not automatic)

*** Finishing grace note and parenthesis

*** Intermediate notes and parenthesis

** Trills

*** Only long slurs and octave signs go above the trill

*** Line lasts for entire note (sib doesn't follow ties), stops right at next notehead or its accidental (sib won't notice) or to barline

*** Accidental by creating a new symbol and a new line

*** Grace note for a defined pitch in parenthesis with an X shift, hide flag, drag stem down

*** Grace note terminations

** Tremolos

*** input at half value, choose beam numbers

*** tied to next measure with slurs

*** break beams (auto?)

** Arpeggios

*** Extends all notes (not stems)

*** Cross staff if there's an accidental

** Octave Signs

*** Above almost all other notation

*** Slur vs triplet vs octave depend on longest

*** Change style if wanted

*** How long it goes controversy

*** Ledger lines, octave signs, or clef changes?

*** loco to turn back
