#+title: shaping skinner


Skinner would shape his cane dry, so he'd tie the cane down on a dowel after profiling. Then he would use a #11 exacto blade to feather the cane down to the narrowest point, not to the butt. Then after the first half of the reed was shaped, he would flip it (implying a straight shaper) and go from the butt to the narrowest point.

He also would shape by creating masking tape copies of brass templates that he made of other shapes. Then he put the tape on the cane and cut around the edges.
