#+title: testing bocals

1) Any marks, letters, brands, etc. need to be covered
2) Performer must make the decision - no input from others during testing
3) Use current bocal as a standard for comparison
4) Same test notes on each bocal
5) No prior warming up or additional notes at all
6) Try to test only once, maybe twice. More than that and you get used to it
7) As soon as a better one is found, that is the new standard
8) Used a b flat arpeggio from Bb to high D, slurred, at mf. Focus could be on the sound not the music
9) After the best is found, a direct comparison of current bocal and new with excerpts. He did Tchaik 4, Firebird, and Bolero, but said 2nd movements of Mozart or Weber would work as well
