#+title: foldover shaper

Cooper prefers the foldover shaper because he claims that most straight shaper's don't match on all four sides. You can also create problems if you don't foldover at the exact middle of the shaper later. The foldover shaper will gaurantee that at least the sides touching each other will be a match and the fold is good. He says it also helps to begin establishing the degeneratvie/regenerative function of the tip.

He does admit that acceptable results can be obtained with the straight shaper.
