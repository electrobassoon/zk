#+title: reed journal

Weissenborn is perhaps the first to mention having a reed journal. [[cite:&schillinger16_bassoon_reed_makin]] 91. This practice was reinstated by Skinner, Herzberg, Christlieb, and probably Cooper too. 

Skinner made students take notes and make two copies of them. One for the student and one for him to help them later.
