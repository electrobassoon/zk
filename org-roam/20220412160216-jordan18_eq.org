Perspective performers of electroacoustic music will need:

A computer, that has at least 8gb of ram and preferrably a solid state drive.
An audio interface that has at least 2 inputs and 4 outputs.
PA speakers
2 Cardioid condenser mics
In ear monitors
Audio software
MIDI controller

Using a daw for basic effects like delay and reverb may have better return than getting physical pedals
Learning a DAW likely has more applications than max/msp and pure data do for beginners
